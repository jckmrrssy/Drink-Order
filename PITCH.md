### Elevator Pitch
Bars are a business, and thus, they need to make money. The main crux of how much money an establishment can make is what they should charge for liquor. Charge too little, and the bar will bleed money. Charge too much, and the clientele will stop coming in and pumping money into the place. So a happy medium needs to be found, to enable the bar to make money, while still enticing customers in. Our app, "Drink Order", seeks to streamline the process for bars, giving them an easy to use application so they can find that "happy medium" when it comes to pricing the drinks that they serve to customer.

### Description
Here's how the app works: 
    So, let's say that you want to figure out how much you should charge for a gin and tonic. But you've got multiple factors to consider, such as, type of gin being used, how much that type of gin costs, what size the bottle is, and how much gin will go into it. In addition, you have to figure out how much the tonic will cost, and how much you are going to use. And that's just for one type of alcohol and one type of drink. Try figuring all of that for that one, and then realize you have to do it for every drink in the place, daunting, right? And what a certain type of alcohol gets more expensive? Now you've got to go back and change the price on every drink that uses that type of booze.

This app allows you to put in how much you are paying for each bottle of alcohol and the size of it, and determines how much it will cost per ounce, and repeats the same for the mixers. Once that information is in the database, you can go make a recipe, inputting the ingredients and their quantities. The next step would be to enter in how much of a markup on the price that you want to do. Once that is completed, the app would spit out the perfect price for your drink, saving you time and energy in the process.

The app will also have an area to store any recipes you may make, enabling you to edit them, add more, or refer to them over time. 

### Why It's Useful
The goal of any business is to remain open and profitable, and our app aims to enable bars/restaurants to acheive that with as little as fuss as possible. There are enough headaches that go into running this type of establishment, and if our app can streamline a large aspect of the business, it will make it that much more likely that the bar will succeed.

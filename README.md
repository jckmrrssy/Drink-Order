## Planned updates

At the moment, this app is the minimum viable product. We hope to make updates to improve the UI/UX, and add more pricing functionality and features (such as setting a target cost, markup %, etc). We also have plans to build out a mobile version of the application using React Native, to make it even easier for managers to quickly price out their menus.
